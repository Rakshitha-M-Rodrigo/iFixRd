<===== About Cartoon Themes for WinRAR =====>

The Cartoon themes I made have 4 sizes: 32x32, 48x48, 64x64 and 80x80, while the size I used in the preview image is 64x64.

Simply double click on the "*.theme.rar" file and the installation will be finished in a while. After that, you can choose my themes from the "Option -> Themes" menu to apply it. However, the themes only work with WinRAR 3.50 and higher versions.

NO MODIFICATIONS, PORT OR REDISTRIBUTION WITHOUT PERMISSION!!
